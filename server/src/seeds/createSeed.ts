A little bright light
Behind her eyes
I capture with mine.
It twirls and dances
And soon takes flight.
Twisting and weaving
It beckons I follow,
I never lose sight.

I feel the warm sun,
A little snug embrace
Behind her smile
I capture with mine.
It skips and sways
And soon kneels down.
Soothing and calming
It beckons I slow,
I catch my breath.

I know a quiet place,
A little peaceful nest
Behind her heart
I capture with mine.
It ebbs and flows
And soon makes rest.
Sitting and breathing
It beckons I stop.`,

I hunt and thrash
I swim where I please,
My queen of the seas.

I am the fruit and the wheat
I am the planting and the harvest
I am nature's rebirth,

I warm and I guide
I am the hand of something higher,

That I saw in my closet.
It was green, it was mean,
It was dirty and it knows it.
Slither slather -
Wither wather!

My eyes got big,
And next I saw
Some feet in my closet.
Under my clothes, the little gnomes
Were smelly and they know it.
Sniffle snaffle -
Wiffle waffle!

My eyes were big,
My nose got scrunched,
And next I heard
Some laughter in my closet.
The fairies took joy with all my toys,
They're messy and they know it.
Giggle gaggle -
Wiggle waggle!

My eyes were big,
My nose was scrunched,
My ears turned red,
And then I felt
Something grimy in my closet.
Goblin crumbs got on my thumbs,
That's icky and they know it.
Sticky stacky -
Wicky wacky!

My eyes were big,
My nose was scrunched,
My ears were red,
My hands made fists,
I had enough!
I told my mom
I couldn't clean my closet!

Her eyes got big!
Her nose got scrunched!
Her ears got red!
Her hands made fists!

... and then I cleaned my closet.`,

Seen starlit oceans and the darkest alleys

Of strength, peace, happiness and joy
I knew so well as a boy
The language seems foreign, I don't understand
But I hear the echo and it steadies my hand
To find the source feels right in my heart
I looked around but don't know where to start`,

You have a warm place to lay
I knew not your plot until I got home
When the bathroom mirror revealed thy form

At what hour did you dare escape?
Who else saw thy thin black shape?
You've caused me pain, hair so vain
My day was a parade, and thee, the rain

With tweezers in hand I grab thy strand
With quick twist of the wrist my...
Wait, I feel nothing, I missed
So with tweezers in hand I grab thy strand
And with quick twist of the wrist my eyes mist

There you are held by cheap metal
My nose a rose and thee a black petal
A bitter end to a sweet day
Stray too far and you will pay`,

Under the crown of violet what began has ended
And with the sum of it all a blank page becomes splendid`,

to cool in the peppermint wind.

Let us leave this place where the smoke blows black
and the dark street winds and bends.
Past the pits where the asphalt flowers grow
we shall walk with a walk that is measured and slow
and watch where the chalk-white arrows go
to the place where the sidewalk ends.

Yes we'll walk with a walk that is measured and slow,
and we'll go where the chalk-white arrows go,
for the children, they mark, and the children, they know,
the place where the sidewalk ends. `,
